## About me
Hi, I'm Pedro! I'm a Brazilian
programmer and musician on the side

Some random facts, in order of relevancy:
- I can speak Portuguese and English, but I'd love to learn Japanese and/or Italian;
- My favourite programming languages to code in are C and Python. Go is working its way in, though;
- I don't like AI art;
- I do like generative art (not AI art, more like Vera Moln√°r's stuff and [this](https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/words/flow-fields))
- I'm a big fan of Progressive Rock (though I also love some MPB...)
- I like putting a nose in my emoticon. Look at this guy :-D;
- I started coding at age 14;

You can find me PBnJK on most websites, and BeepsNBoops on music stuff. Links on
the footer!

## About the blog
Here I'll post some random stuff I think of. Sometimes it'll be long and well-structured;
other times it'll be short and more "spur of the moment". There'll be some opinion
pieces, and there will be some more "factual" articles. Don't worry, the former won't be
*political* opinions or anything of the sort---You don't need to be forced to read a
teen's opinion on politics---just whatever I currently feel about something I like.

Opinion posts will be under the "talk" tag, and the non-opinion ones will be under
"fact". Names subject to change, probably...
